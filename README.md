# ‚òÄÔ∏è TypeScript Weather App

**Team:** Daniel, Mikaela, Bj√∂rn  
**Duration:** 1 week (Week 1 of 2)  
**Presentation:** Friday, October 24 ‚Äì with guest developers from **SMHI** üå¶Ô∏è  

---

## üéØ This Week‚Äôs Goal

Build a **responsive Weather App** using **TypeScript** and the **SMHI API**.  
Focus on **writing strongly-typed, clean code** while learning how to:

- Set up and structure a **TypeScript project**
- **Fetch and display live weather data** (city, temperature, forecast)
- Collaborate through **mob programming and GitHub**
- Follow a **provided UI design** and make it responsive
- Prepare to **present the finished app** to SMHI developers


## Look at Figma

- Familirize with it
- Choose on of the designs https://www.figma.com/design/xmgn8iNdODrBihUdQV4t3q/Technigo-%E2%80%93-Weather-App?node-id=0-1&t=5s6v5VAoZK9rXsY8-1
- Break out in to components to Github issues

## Front end development
- Build the HTML & CSS
- Check out & test the API
- Set up TypeScript & JS
- Netlify setup

To do:
  - H√§mta APIn fr√•n SMHI

  - H√§mta vilka parametrar:
    Meta: condition, dagens temp, sunrise, sunset
    Condition: v√§der, long/lat
    Veckolista: Dagar fr.o.m dagens, dagens v√§der
    Tema: condition


Stretch goal: 
  S√∂kruta: flera long/lat

- vilka types i TS
